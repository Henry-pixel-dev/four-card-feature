### ðŸ§¾ The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Understand the visual structure and hierarchy of the cards

## ðŸ”¨ Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts

## ðŸ’¡ What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of **CSS Grid**, especially:

- Using `grid-template-areas`, `grid-column`, and `grid-row` to precisely place elements
- Spanning rows and columns based on layout design
- Visualizing grid lines using browser DevTools

```css
/* Example of placing a card in Grid */
.card.team {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
}
